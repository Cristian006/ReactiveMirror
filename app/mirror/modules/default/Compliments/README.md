# Compliments
The `compliments` module is one of the default modules of the MagicMirror.
This module displays a random compliment.

		module: "Compliments",
		position: "lower_third",	// This can be any of the regions.
									// Best results in one of the middle regions like: lower_third
		config: {
			// The config property is optional.
			// If no config is set, the default compliments are shown.
			// See 'Configuration options' for more information.
		}
	}
]
````

### Compliment configuration

The `compliments` property contains an object with four arrays: <code>morning</code>, <code>afternoon</code>, <code>evening</code> and <code>anytime</code>. Based on the time of the day, the compliments will be picked out of one of these arrays. The arrays contain one or multiple compliments.


If use the currentweather is possible use a actual weather for set compliments. The availables properties are:
* `day_sunny`
* `day_cloudy`
* `cloudy`
* `cloudy_windy`
* `showers`

````javascript
config: {
	compliments: {
		day_sunny: [
			"Today is a sunny day",
			"It's a beautiful day"
		],
		snow: [
			"Snowball battle!"
		],
		rain: [
			"Don't forget your umbrella"
		]
	}
}
````

````javascript
config: {
	compliments: {
		anytime: [
			"Hey there sexy!"
		],
		morning: [
			"Good morning, handsome!",
			"Enjoy your day!",
			"How was your sleep?"
		],
		afternoon: [
			"Hello, beauty!",
			"You look sexy!",
			"Looking good today!"
		],
		evening: [
			"Wow, you look hot!",
			"You look nice!",
			"Hi, sexy!"
		]
	}
}
````

### External Compliment File
You may specify an external file that contains the three compliment arrays. This is particularly useful if you have a
large number of compliments and do not wish to crowd your `config.js` file with a large array of compliments.
Adding the `remoteFile` variable will override an array you specify in the configuration file.

This file must be straight JSON. Note that the array names need quotes
around them ("morning", "afternoon", "evening", "snow", "rain", etc.).
#### Example compliments.json file:
````json
{
    "anytime" : [
        "Hey there sexy!"
    ],
    "morning" : [
        "Good morning, sunshine!",
        "Who needs coffee when you have your smile?",
        "Go get 'em, Tiger!"
    ],
    "afternoon" : [
        "Hitting your stride!",
        "You are making a difference!",
        "You're more fun than bubble wrap!"
    ],
    "evening" : [
        "You made someone smile today, I know it.",
        "You are making a difference.",
        "The day was better for your efforts."
    ]
}
